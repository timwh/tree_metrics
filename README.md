# tree_metrics
## Derive metrics from segmented point cloud with unique tree IDs

Extract tree crowns as polygons using 2D alpha shapes.

Assign metrics to these polygons:
  - Crown area (m^2) -
  - Maximum diameter of crown (m) - max planar distance between points
  - Average diameter of crown (m) - 
  - Tree height (m) - Ground to tip of crown
  - Crown height (m) - Base to tip of crown
  - Crown volume (m^3) -
